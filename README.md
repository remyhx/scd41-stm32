# Sensirion SCD4X for STM32
---

A simple lib to readout and set options of the Sensirion SCD4X (mostly SCD41). I use it in my projects, first for the
ESP32, but translated it for the STM32 with HAL functions.

Datasheet Sensirion: [datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/48C4B7FB/6426E14D/CD_DS_SCD40_SCD41_Datasheet_D1_052023.pdf).

## Getting Started

Just add the two files in your project and don't forget to add them to the cmakelists.txt, for example:

```cmake
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}        
    Core/Src/Lib/scd41.c
)

include_directories(
    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/Core/Inc/Lib
    )
```

Change the I2C handler in the scd41.h file to the one you use

```h
#define I2C_HANDLER   hi2c1                 // I2C handler, change to the I2C handler
```


## Program usage

The lib registers the mode of operation (single shot, continuous, low power continuous), feel free to use or not use in your
project. I start with:

```c
//Resetting by stopping the previous mode of the sensor
lightResetScd41();      
  
//Starting the continuous mode and readout if it was a succes, or not in result
scd41_err_t result = startPeriodicMeasurementScd41();
```

If you want to change some settings like altitude, do this between those two functions.

To readout the sensor:

```c
// Wait for the sensor to be ready (every 5 seconds for the normal mode, 30 seconds low power mode.)
while (dataReadyScd41() != SCD41_OK)
{
    HAL_Delay(500);
}

// Read the sensor data
SensorData readSensorData;

result = readScd41(&readSensorData);
```

## Error Handling

The lib functions typically return an `scd41_err_t` type, which indicates the success or failure of the operation:

- `SCD41_OK`: The operation was successful.
- `SCD41_ERR_I2C`: Error while transmitting I2C data.
- `SCD41_ERR_CRC`: Error while calculating CRC.
- `SCD41_ERR_MEASUREMENT`: Error while reading sensor data (not I2C).
- `SCD41_ERR_NOT_READY`: Sensor not ready.
- `SCD41_ERR_SLEEPING`: Sensor is sleeping.
- `SCD41_COMMAND_IGNORED`: Command ignored, like because it was already running.
- `SCD41_ERR_MALFUNCTION`: Sensor malfunction.
- `SCD41_ERR_UNKNOWN`: Error unknown/not described.
